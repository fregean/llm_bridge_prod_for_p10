  Score: 5
  Definition (Overall Evaluation): Completely Valid/Accurate
  Typical Characteristics: |
    Logical development is consistent, with no factual errors.
    All premises are clearly stated, leading inevitably to the conclusion.
    Uncertain points are appropriately qualified.
  Example (Summary): In a math problem, demonstrates the steps of theorem -> algebraic expansion -> numerical calculation in order to derive the correct answer.

  Score: 4
  Definition (Overall Evaluation): Mostly Valid
  Typical Characteristics: |
    Minor leaps in logic or ambiguous expressions exist, but they are not critical.
    Minor omissions of fact or errors in peripheral information.
  Example (Summary): In a history problem, omits some dates but correctly explains character relationships and causality to arrive at the correct answer.

  Score: 3
  Definition (Overall Evaluation): Partially Valid
  Typical Characteristics: |
    Gaps in the logical path require the reader to fill them in.
    Some factual errors exist but have a minor impact on the conclusion.
  Example (Summary): In a physics problem, the choice of formula is correct, but the intermediate calculations are sloppy, and the result is barely correct.

  Definition (Overall Evaluation): Lacking in Validity
  Typical Characteristics: |
    Logical leaps are conspicuous, and the basis is ambiguous.
    Contains factual errors or contradictions.
  Example (Summary): For an ethics question, confuses term definitions and provides an incorrect answer with an incoherent argument.

  Score: 1
  Definition (Overall Evaluation): Inappropriate/Irrelevant
  Typical Characteristics: |
    Reasoning is incoherent or irrelevant to the gist of the question.
    There is virtually no evidence to support the answer.
  Example (Summary): In a math problem, states "I intuitively think this" without showing any formulas and gives an incorrect answer.
